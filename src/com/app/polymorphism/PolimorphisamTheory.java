	 * 1). The ability of an object to take many forms
	 * 2). In java we can achieve polymorphism in two ways
	 *     (i) MethodOverLoading
	 *     (ii)MethodOverRiding
	 * 
	 * MethodOverLoading:-
	 * ==================
	 *                   In class more than one method has same name but different parameters.
	 *    
	 *                   
	 * Rules for MethodOverLoading:-
	 * ============================
	 * 1. MethodName should be same.
	 * 2. MethodReturnType should be same.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * MethodOverRiding:-
	 * ==================
	 *                  If we don't want parent class methods inplimentation logic we override in child class.
	 * Rules for MethodOverRiding:-
	 * ============================
	 * 1. private methods we can't override.
	 * 2. static methods we can't override.
	 * 3. final methods we can't override.
	 * 4. we can't decrease access specifier scope in overriding.(public-->private==>Invalid) (private-->public,protected==>valid)
	 * 5. we can't override constructors.
	 * 6. we can't override abstract methods.
