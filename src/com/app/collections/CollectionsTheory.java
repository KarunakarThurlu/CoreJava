	 *Collection:-
	 *============
	 *            To represent group of individual objects as single entity.
	 *
	 *Collection Framework:-
	 *=====================
	 *						It Contains Group of Classes and Interfaces, which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as single entity.
	 *Array:-An Array is indexed collection of fixed numner of homogeneous data elements.
	 *=====
	 * The Main advantage of arrays is we can represent multiple values by using single variable so that readable of the code will be improved.
	 * 
	 * Limitations of Arrays:-
	 * ======================
	 * 1). Arrays are fixed in size i.e once we creates an array there is no chance of increasing or decreasing size based on user requirement , Due this ,to use arrays concept compusalry we should know the size in advance which may not possible always. 
	 * 2). Arrays can hold only homogeous datatype Elements,
	 *     We can solve this problem by Using Object Type Arrays(Object o[]=new Object())
	 * 3). Arrays Concept is not implemented some standard datastructure and hence readymate methods support is not available, for Every Requirement we have to write the code explicitly which increases complexity of programing.
	 *
	 *		To Over above problems of arrays we should go for collections concept.
	 *
	 * 1). Collections are growable in nature i.e based on our requirement we can increase (or) Decrese the size.
	 * 2). Collections can hold both homogeneous and hetrogeneous objects.
	 * 3). Every Collection Class is implemented based some standard datastructure hence for every requirement readymate method support is available,
	 *     Being a programmer we are responsable to use those methods and we not responsable to implement those methods.
	 *   
	 *Diff b/n Arrays and Collections:-
	 *================================
	 *1).Arrays are fixed in size.                1).Collections are growable.
	 *2).Memory is important ,Don't use Arrays.	  2).Memory is not important use Collections.
	 *3).Performance is high.  				   	  3).Performance is low comparing with Arrays.
	 *4).No Underlying DataStructure and	   	  4).Each Collection class has DataStructure hence
	 *   hence ready mate methods are not there.      in built methods methods are there.
	 *   for each requirement we have to write.
	 *5).Arrays Can hold Both Primitive Objects.  5).Collections can hold Only Object Types But not Primitive.                                     
	 *
	 *Collection Definition:-
	 *======================
	 *                      To represent group of individual objects as single entity.
	 *
	 *
	 *Collection(I)VsCollections(C):-
	 *========================
	 *Collection(I)  is An Interface ,To Represent group of individual objects as single entity then go for Collection.
	 *Collections(C) is a Class which contains generic methods And These generic methods applicable for all implementation classes of Collection.
